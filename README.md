# Beholder
The main control software for the Beholder (a robot used by the Cal Poly Mech Warfare team). The goal of this robot *was* to create a wide field of view robot using as many cameras as we *could* interface with a Raspberry Pi 4. Unfortunately we are still locked out of the robotics club at the moment of writing this, and all competitions that this could have been entered in have vanished. Part of the problem was the virus, the other part of the problem was the fact that the competition was usually held at the Maker Faire or something of the like (all bankrupt). So, yeah, project abandoned for now.

## Abandoned due to Covid-19 :(
